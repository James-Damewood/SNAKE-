Goal here is to create a multiplayer version of Snake. In general, the goal will be to grow your snake as large as possible without being eliminated by walls, objects, or your opponents.

Modes for victory can be:
(1) Eliminate all other snakes
(2) Largest snake in given time
(3) First snake to reach a specific size

Additional Modes may allow for other  such as periodic boundary conditions (snake passing through top appears at the bottom)

Further Goals include using Reinforcement Learning to build an A.I.

Accomplished Tasks:
Build Single Player
Build Reinforcement Learning approach for single player


Reinforcement learning approach is built off of Adam Pazke's tutorial, which can be found here:
