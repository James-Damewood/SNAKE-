Goal here is to create a multiplayer version of Snake. In general, the goal will be to grow your snake as large as possible without being eliminated by walls, objects, or your opponents.

Modes for victory can be:
(1) Eliminate all other snakes
(2) Largest snake in given time
(3) First snake to reach a specific size

Additional Modes may allow for other scenarios such as periodic boundary conditions (snake passing through top appears at the bottom)

Further Goals include using Reinforcement Learning to build an automated opponent.



The reinforcement learning approach is a version of Adam Pazke's tutorial adapted to this application, which can be found here:
